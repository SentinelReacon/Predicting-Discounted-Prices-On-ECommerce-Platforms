# Predicting-Discounted-Prices-On-ECommerce-Platforms

All the E-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and Flipkart, are offering products at discounted prices. This machine-learning project is all about predicting those discounted prices from the data given in the CSV file. This project uses basic machine-learning algorithms to train on the given dataset and predict values on unseen test datasets. Fine-tuning algorithms to lower the RMSE value is also done to make the model more accurate and efficient.
